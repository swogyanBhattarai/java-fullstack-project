# Java Fullstack Learning Project

## Overview
This is a personal learning project where I am building my understanding of **Java from the ground up**, gradually moving toward creating a fullstack web application.  

The project is built using **Spring Boot**.

## API Endpoints

### User Endpoints

- **GET `/user`** – Returns a list of all users.
- **POST `/user`** – Adds a new user to the system.
- **GET `/user/{id}`** – Retrieves a single user by their ID.
- **PUT `/user/{id}`** – Updates a user's information by ID.
- **DELETE `/user/{id}`** - Deletes a user's information by ID.

---
### Transaction Endpoints

- **POST `/transaction/{id}`** - Adds a new transaction. ID specifies which user to add it to.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in **IntelliJ IDEA**
3. Make sure **SQLite JDBC driver** is included in `pom.xml`
4. Run the Spring Boot application
5. Use **Postman** or a frontend to test API endpoints

## Notes
- This is a **learning project**, so some practices are kept simple for clarity.
- The repository structure and code will evolve as I progress through more advanced Spring Boot and fullstack topics.
- The progress table above can be updated regularly to track learning milestones.
